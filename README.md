# HERUM - Online videogames store

This is a project to create an ecommerce platform for video games where users can choose and purchase a wide variety of video games. We have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON Server focusing on calls to the fake API to fetch data from that API and render it on the website.

# Description

HERUM is an online video game store that aims to offer an interactive experience to its users. The website allows users to choose from different video games of all genres, platforms, and find the best deals. Additionally, emphasis is placed on creativity in design and on the organization, cleanliness, and semantic structure of the code.

# Technologies Used

- HTML: Used to structure the content before making it dynamic in JS.
- CSS: Employed to provide style and design to the page, controlling visual aspects such as colors, fonts, margins, etc.
- JavaScript: Used to add interactivity, providing dynamic functionalities such as cart functionality, page dynamism, API calls, and admin tasks (CRUD).
